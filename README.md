# Learn Terraform with Azure

So you want to learn Terraform and work with Microsoft Azure.

This repository (repo) is a ever growing source of knowledge in using Terraform to manage Azure. The repo is public with the first learning module **Getting Started** available to follow. More learning modules will be released over time but click here to look at what I have so far and see whats in the pipeline.

## Where to start?

The learning modules operate from Visual Studio Code using a extension called CodeTour. You will need to:

- Install Visual Studio Code
- Install CodeTour (Publisher: Jonathan Carter) from the extensions
- Install Git
- Install Terraform
- Install Azure CLI

I've only test run the learning modules using Windows. Any other operating system may result in scripts/code to error.

An Azure Subscription is required to follow the modules. If you don't have one already, you can signup to a [trial subscription here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/).

## Whats next?

Once all the software is installed, you can go ahead and fork the repository. All you need to do is select the **Fork** button at the top right of this page.

When the fork is completed, open it within GitHub and select the **Code** button and copy the **HTTPS** address. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Clone Repository** button. Paste the HTTPS address to clone the fork.

Once done, CodeTour should start automatically. Follow the Introudction module first to make sure you have everything you need and then proceed to the next module.
